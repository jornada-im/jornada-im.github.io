## Citing the Jornada

Please cite Jornada data when you use it. You can do this in the reference section of a journal article, which is preferable, or the data availability statement of some journals. We'll are encouraging this practice more and more, and will be developing better guidelines and, we hope, data citation statistics in the future.
