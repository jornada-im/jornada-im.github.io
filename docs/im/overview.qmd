title: Overview for Jornada Information Managers
---

Jornada data managers, including the IM team, should follow LTER and Jornada standards and best practices when creating metadata files and publishing research data packages. 

# Dataset tracking

We use Trello for this. For LTER datasets there are three Trello boards that represent how Jornada datasets are split into three categories:

1. Core - ongoing, high priority datasets that are updated regularly (once per year we hope). Many of these are collected by the JRN field crew.
2. Non-core - lower-priority and completed datasets.
3. Works in progress ('WIP') - datasets that are brand new or as-yet unpublished. Many are in the development/review phase, or are awaiting publication of results associated with the data.

Contact someone on the IM team to get added to these boards.

# Data management resources

If you are wondering whether the content or format of a metadata file (EML) is correct and complete, see our metadata standards documents. They are specific to Jornada Basin LTER data packages. **THESE ARE DRAFTS** and subject to change!

* [General Jornada metadata standards](https://jornada-im.github.io/documentation/JRN_metadata_standards) for all data packages (this is a bit out of date)
* [Jornada keyword thesauri](https://github.com/jornada-im/documentation/raw/main/standards_src/keyword_thesauri.xlsx) (.xlsx) list keywords that should appear in all Jornada metadata files.
* Also see the full [Jornada IM documentation pages](https://jornada-im.github.io/documentation)
