This page was written by Jornada information managers (IMs) to provide a concise, but fairly comprehensive guide to research administration and data management for Jornada students and investigators, including PIs, postdocs, graduate students, undergraduate researchers, and staff scientists.

# Research approval and policies

Most new research projects are initiated through the Jornada Research Site Manager, John Anderson (<janderso@nmsu.edu>). The [JRN website](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/for-researchers) or the [JER website](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/ltar/data/documentation) are the best source of information on this process, and have the current forms needed. To begin the approval process, a potential researcher submits a Research Notification (ResNotif) form, which describes the planned location, research activities, personnel, and other important project information, to John Anderson. After review, and after any necessary changes to the plan are made, the project may be approved to begin.

All approved research projects at the Jornada must agree to a data sharing and acknowledgement policy. The requirements for Jornada researchers are, again, detailed on the [JRN](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/for-researchers) or [JER](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/ltar/data/documentation) websites, but to summarize, researchers should:

1. Submit research data and metadata for publication
    - We require most researchers to submit data and metadata yearly to our research data archive. We publish this data in open-access repositories at the time research results are peer-reviewed and published, or no later than 2 years after collection. This keeps the program in step with the [LTER data policy](https://lternet.edu/data-access-policy/) and other relevant guidelines.
2. Keep research project information up to date
    - We ask that approved projects submit any major post-approval changes to the project as a revised ResNotif form, or at a minimum regularly provide updates on the project, its personnel, and progress.
3. Acknowledge Jornada LTER and USDA-ARS support
    - The support recieved, name of the program, and relevant grant numbers should be included in the acknowledgement section of any journal article, dissertation, or other publication. Support is defined as direct funding of research or personnel costs allocated from the Jornada grants, fellowship support to graduate students, logistical or data collection support from the Jornada field crew, or data management services from the Jornada Information Management team.
4. Cite the Jornada LTER and USDA-ARS data used in your research
    - When research findings involving Jornada data appear in a publication (journal article, dissertation, website, etc.), please include a citation and link to the original data. For already-published long-term datasets include a DOI link at a minimum, and if possible, a full citation in the reference section (e.g. in a journal article). If the data are new and unpublished, please publish the dataset AND cite it in the publication.

The Jornada IM team strives to uphold high data publishing standards, so Jornada students and investigators who contribute to research at the Jornada should be aware of, or be willing to learn about, some best practices for collecting and describing their research data.


# Cleaning and describing data

The Jornada IM team applies its signifiant experience and a variety of tools during the quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) of long-term Jornada datasets. For data managed by individual researchers, the Jornada IM team leaves most data QA/QC practices up to the individual (or lab), but is happy to help when asked. For a simple overview and some resources useful for QA/QC of tabular data, see [the second phase](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/five-phases-of-data-publishing/phase-2/) in EDI's 5 phases of data publishing.

Once data are clean and ready to analyze or publish, it is best to describe the data with metadata that is as detailed as needed to allow interpretation and re-use. [EDI's five phases](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/resources/five-phases-of-data-publishing/phase-3/) has more guidance here, and the Jornada IM team tries to offer extensive assistance to researchers who need to describe their datasets for publication. Its a good idea to start collecting and organizing metadata as soon as you start collecting data, and one of the simplest ways to do this may be with one of the Jornada metadata templates we've created.

## Metadata templates

A metadata template will help you fill in all necessary and relevant metadata to accompany your data for publication. The [Jornada metadata template](https://github.com/jornada-im/documentation/raw/main/templates/Jornada_metadata_template.docx) is a Word file (.docx) with a section and instructions for each essential component of metadata that should accompany a published dataset. It also includes some non-essential, but still useful metadata elements.  Completed templates and data files should be sent to the Jornada IM team.

* We are currently working on some other options for metadata collection, including spreadsheets and web forms, that will appear here in the future. 
* While writing metadata, the [Jornada metadata standards](https://github.com/jornada-im/documentation/raw/main/standards/JRN_metadata_standards.docx) (.docx) and [keyword thesauri](https://github.com/jornada-im/documentation/raw/main/standards/keyword_thesauri.xlsx) (.xlsx) documents are helpful, but not required.

# Publishing datasets

Preparation and publication of a Jornada dataset is usually an iterative process (Figure 1). Researchers submit data and metadata to a Jornada Information Manager who then securely archives the data and checks these items for quality and consistency. Usually there is a period of communication and updates between the IM and the researcher until the dataset is ready for publication. Once it is, the IM encodes the data into something called an EML file, and then sends it, with the data, to the Environmental Data Initiative repository (EDI) as a published dataset. There are other variations on this process, depending on the data, but this is the most common.

# Jornada data discovery

The goal of the Jornada IM system is to have as much Jornada data as possible accessible through the data catalogs and other applications on our websites. There are several such catalogs and apps:
* The [JRN LTER primary data catalog](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/data-catalog/) currently provides access to all Jornada data held in the EDI repository.
* On the same page, a [catalog for data in other repositories](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/data-catalog/#uagb-tabs__tab1) provides access to Jornada data held outside of EDI.
* The [interactive data viewer](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/interactive-data-viewer/) allows map-based browsing of some of our long-term meterology and ecology datasets collected at the Jornada.
* The [spatial data catalog](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu/spatial-data/) is a listing of a few of the most useful spatial datasets the Jornada has.


# Citing the Jornada

Please cite Jornada data when you use it. You can do this in the reference section of a journal article, which is preferable, or the data availability statement of some journals. We'll are encouraging this practice more and more, and will be developing better guidelines and, we hope, data citation statistics in the future.

# Learn more about Jornada data management

The Jornada IM team consists of both Jornada Basin LTER (JRN) and USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range (JER) staff. If you need to know more about how we manage data, or how you or your lab can do a better job with data, there are a number of opportunities to learn more.
