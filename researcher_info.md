# Information For Jornada Researchers 

PIs, postdocs, students, staff scientists and others who contribite to research at the Jornada should be aware of the standards and requirements for collecting and documenting their research data.


## Metadata templates

When starting a new data collection effort, or assembling metadata for an existing one, it helps to have a metadata template. The word documents below will help you fill in all necessary and relevant metadata to accompany your data for publication. The EDI template is recommended (and easiest to use) for now. We may revise it to be specific to the Jornada LTER in the future.

* Get the [EDI metadata template](https://github.com/EDIorg/MetadataTemplates/raw/master/EDI_metadata_template.docx) (link to github).
* Older Jornada metadata templates [are on the Jornada website](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/lter/data/documentation)
* While writing metadata, the [Jornada metadata standards](https://github.com/jornada-im/jrn_metadata_standards/raw/master/JRN_metadata_standards.docx) (.docx) and [keyword thesauri](https://github.com/jornada-im/jrn_metadata_standards/raw/master/keyword_thesauri.xlsx) (.xlsx) documents may be helpful, but are not required.

###LTER/EDI resources

Jornada Basin LTER data packages are generally submitted to the EDI (Environmental Data Initiative) repository. They have resources about data collection, curation, and publishing.
