# Information For Jornada Researchers 

PIs, postdocs, students, staff scientists and others who contribite to research at the Jornada should be aware of the standards and requirements for collecting and documenting their research data.


## Metadata templates

When you start a new data collection effort, or must assemble metadata for an existing one, it helps to have a metadata template. The word documents below can be filled in with all necessary and relevant metadata to accompany your data for publication. The EDI template is recommended (and easiest to use) for now. We may revise it to be specific to the Jornada LTER in the future.

* Get the [EDI metadata template](https://github.com/EDIorg/MetadataTemplates/blob/master/EDI_metadata_template.docx) (link to github).
* Older Jornada metadata templates [are on the Jornada website](https://jornada.nmsu.edu/lter/data/documentation)


## Jornada metadata standards

If you are wondering whether the content or format of your metadata is correct and complete, please see our metadata standards documents. They are specific to the Jornada Basin LTER data packages. Warning: THESE ARE DRAFTS and subject to change!

* [General Jornada metadata standards](https://github.com/jornada-im/jrn_metadata_standards/blob/master/JRN_metadata_standards.docx) for all data packages
* Use the [Jornada keyword thesauri](https://github.com/jornada-im/jrn_metadata_standards/blob/master/keyword_thesauri.xlsx) for help adding metadata keywords



## LTER/EDI resources

Jornada Basin LTER data packages are generally submitted to the EDI (Environmental Data Initiative) data repository. They have resources about data collection, curation, and publishing.

* EDIs [5 phases of data publishing](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/resources/five-phases-of-data-publishing/)
