For LTER datasets there are three Trello boards that represent how Jornada datasets are split into three categories:\n\nCore - ongoing, high priority datasets that are updated regularly (once per year we hope). Many of these are collected by the JRN field crew.\nNon-core - lower-priority and completed datasets.\nWorks in progress (‘WIP’) - datasets that are brand new or as-yet unpublished. Many are in the development/review phase, or are awaiting publication of results associated with the data.\n\nContact someone on the IM team to get added to these boards.\n\n\nData management resources\nIf you are wondering whether the content or format of a metadata file (EML) is correct and complete, see our metadata standards documents. They are specific to Jornada Basin LTER data packages. THESE ARE DRAFTS and subject to change!\n\nGeneral Jornada metadata standards for all data packages (this is a bit out of date)\nJornada keyword thesauri (.xlsx) list keywords that should appear in all Jornada metadata files.\nAlso see the full Jornada IM documentation pages",

Named EML elements are surrounded by angle brackets, and there are headings for most important elements. At the Jornada Basin LTER, a variety of tools are being used to create EML documents during the data packaging process (EMLassemblyline, GCE Toolbox +, etc.). Notes about using these tools to create each EML element are present in the relevant section of this document (???Add these in as you edit).\nNote that EML documents are hierarchical. The root element is &lt;eml:eml&gt; (denoted by the path /eml:eml). Below the EML root element are 3 elements, &lt;access&gt;, &lt;dataset&gt;, and &lt;additional_metadata&gt; (paths /eml:eml/access, /eml:eml/dataset, and /eml:eml/additional_metadata). This document contains metadata standards for elements under the &lt;dataset&gt; element of Jornada EML files only.

    "text": "&lt;coverage&gt;\nA &lt;coverage&gt; element can be defined at multiple levels in the EML document: for a &lt;dataset&gt; element (/eml:eml/dataset/coverage), for a data entity (eml:eml/dataset/[entity]/coverage), within a &lt;methods&gt; element (eml:eml/dataset/methods/sampling/studyExtent/coverage), etc. Within each &lt;coverage&gt; element, three types of coverage elements can be defined - &lt;geographicCoverage&gt;, &lt;taxonomicCoverage&gt;, and &lt;temporalCoverage&gt;.\nFor now, at JRN LTER, we are focusing on providing adequate &lt;coverage&gt; metadata at the &lt;dataset&gt; element level, and there aren’t known standards for elements below this level (???). This is described in the sections below.\n\n&lt;geographicCoverage&gt;\nCoordinates for Jornada data packages are obfuscated (deliberately, due to security concerns) in most cases. How, and how much, to provide spatial data is a matter of debate at JRN LTER. The general practice is to provide one or more bounding boxes surrounding the research sites in a data package, but these bounding boxes should not be detailed enough to allow casual visitors to EDI to identify sensitive research sites or instrumentation. Some packages, however, already have finer details in the &lt;geographicCoverage&gt; elements. In these cases the person packaging the data should probably preserve this metadata, and has some discretion on how to proceed after consulting with PIs. The general guideline for this element is outlined below.\nFor &lt;dataset&gt; elements, define at least one &lt;geographicCoverage&gt; element. This &lt;geographicCoverage&gt; element should contain at least one bounding box that encloses all research locations for all data entities in the package. When possible, multiple bounding boxes may be provided as additional &lt;geographicCoverage&gt; elements that describe other study or sampling areas (these may be associated with locational variables in a data entity if you are clever about it). The bounding boxes should be large enough to prevent casual users from identifying the sites (on the EDI map interface, for example).\nEach &lt;geographicCoverage&gt; element should have a &lt;geographicDescription&gt; element associated that describes the location defined by the bounding boxes (or points, as the case may be) and include the text “Higher resolution spatial data for this data package can be obtained by contacting the Data Manager”.\n\n\n&lt;taxonomicCoverage&gt;\nThere are many systems for denoting taxonomic entities or groups, including local systems that are specific to the Jornada Basin LTER or its researchers. JRN data packages that contain taxonomic data (data attributes of species, groups of species, or other taxa) should provide ways to identify the taxonomic entities or groups in a &lt;dataset&gt; to modern, accepted taxonomic classifications at the Genus species or finer levels.\nThese links may be provided in a variable or category in the data entity itself (a “Genus_species” variable, or example), as long as they are properly attributed to an authority like ITIS or USDA PLANTS. Local (JRN specific) taxonomic keys or coding systems that appear in a data entity must be available to the data user. In these cases the keys or coding systems used should be described in the metadata and provided as either an additional data entity in the data package, or as a link to other JRN EDI packages with this information.\nSome current Jornada taxonomic keys are:\n\nKey to vascular plants in the Jornada Basin (an EDI package)\n\n\n\n&lt;temporalCoverage&gt;\nProvide the start and end date of the period over which the data were collected. For &lt;dataset&gt; elements this should include the data in all data entities (all .csv or other data files) that the EML document defines.",

    "text": "Note: This version was subsequently edited by Steve Archer and Greg Maurer before inclusion in the 2020 JRN LTER-VII proposal (table removed, formatting, rewording). The content and intent remains the same.\n\n\nThe core goals of the Information Management (IM) system at the Jornada Basin LTER (JRN) are to support and enhance investigations and data collection, and to make data and other scientific products openly accessible to the science community, resource managers, policy makers, and the public. We are meeting these goals by addressing five IM priorities: (1) design and implement efficient systems to collect, quality-assure, document, and archive research data; (2) annotate research data with complete, standardized metadata; (3) timely publication of data and metadata in accepted research data repositories; (4) promote and facilitate discovery and re-use of JRN research data; and (5) advance sound data management and sharing practices at JRN through leadership and educational activities. The lead Information Manager and other staff use diverse technologies to advance these priorities and hold monthly meetings with JRN PIs to allow oversight of IM activities and promote the development of new goals and procedures.\nOwing to IM deficiencies identified in the renewal proposal review, NSF granted JRN a probationary 2-year LTER award (instead of a full 6-year award) in 2018. A key concern was that JRN data packages were not routinely entered and updated in the Environmental Data Initiative’s data repository (EDI). In response, we: (1) hired a new lead IM (Dr. Greg Maurer, started May 1, 2019), who regularly interacts with LTER Network IMs to learn about technologies, standards, and best-practices and then incorporates them into the JRN IM system; (2) focused our efforts over the past 18 months on writing and updating metadata and publishing new data to EDI, prioritizing our signature datasets (long-term, widely used in JRN or LTER network research); (3) developed the 5 IM priorities listed above; (4) created a new website data catalog that is directly synchronized with the JRN catalog at the EDI data repository; (5) updated our bibliography and personnel information and refreshed the look and feel of the JRN website; and (6) improved communication between the IM team and JRN scientists so they will be aware of, and compliant with, NSF, LTER Network, and JRN data policies. We anticipate that recent modifications to our personnel and practices, as described below, have greatly improved JRN data management and will restore our role as a leader in LTER IM in coming years.\n\n\n\nPersonnel: The JRN “IM team” is headed by G. Maurer. Supported at 1.0 FTE by JRN, Maurer brings a combination of ecological research experience and data management skills to the project. He leads a team comprised of a full-time computer programmer with machine learning expertise (Dr. Geovany Ramirez), a full-time project manager (Dr. Nina Joffe), full-time site manager John Anderson, and half-time database analyst Haneen Omari. The USDA contributions to the team include half-time statistician Darren James who assists Maurer and Omari with data quality assurance, metadata preparation, and EDI data package publication. Project manager Joffe is responsible for JRN website content and ensuring a smooth data publishing process for scientists, from study initiation to completion. USDA staff Scott Schrader and Ken Ramsey maintain servers, shared network resources, and the JRN website stack (Table 1). In addition, JRN scientists and staff contribute software tools for data analysis and visualization and share them as links or embedded apps on the JRN website.\nComputing and storage infrastructure: The JRN IT infrastructure aims to provide diverse, secure, and resilient capabilities for storing and serving information needed by JRN personnel, external collaborators, and the public. The JRN LTER is housed in Wooton Hall, headquarters of the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range (JER), on the New Mexico State University (NMSU) campus. A long-standing ARS-LTER agreement allows the JER to provide and manage most of the local computing infrastructure JRN requires (Table 1), including a cluster of 5 servers with a 100TB storage block. From this cluster, a virtual Ubuntu 16.04 server hosts the JRN website, and JRN staff are provided with CIFS shares for networked file storage. Most JRN research data, IM-related metadata and tools, and staff files and documents (e.g., images, equipment manuals, procedures documents) are also stored on these network shares. Other virtual servers on the same cluster provide additional resources used by JRN, including an R Shiny application server and a MySQL database being tested for research data storage. Hardware updates and upgrades are handled by USDA-ARS staff and NMSU’s Information and Communication Technologies Office, with assistance from JRN as needed. All server and network share files are backed up on a 6-hour schedule, and full, system-wide, off-site tape backups occur monthly. Periodic technology transfers that update hardware, software, and file formats ensure long-term data protection against media or format obsolescence. The JRN IM team uses a variety of secure cloud platforms (e.g. Trello, GitHub, and Zotero.org) to store and manage documentation, bibliographies, and other project data. Off-site personnel that cannot use local network shares may store files in Dropbox or Google Drive depending on project needs and institutional requirements for project members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal/remote resource\nSoftware applications\nImplemented service\n\n\n\n\nDell R710 server cluster\nCitrix Xen Hypervisor\nMiscellaneous virtual server hosting\n\n\nDell R710 server cluster\nUbuntu Linux 16.04, Apache HTTP Server, Drupal 7\nJRN website\n\n\nzotero.org, server cluster\nZotero, Javascript, Drupal\nBibliography (on JRN website)\n\n\nEDI, server cluster\nJavascript, Drupal\nData catalog (on JRN website)\n\n\nLocal storage, server cluster\nCIFS\nNetwork file storage (documents, research data, metadata)\n\n\nDropbox, Google Drive\n\nProject document storage and sharing\n\n\n\nTable 1: JRN computing resources, software, and implemented services used for Information Management.\nNetwork infrastructure: Servers and staff computers are connected to a Gigabit local area network (LAN) linked to the NMSU network (Gigabit Ethernet) through a firewall. Local networked systems and web applications are password-protected, and regular security sweeps identify security threats. The USDA Jornada field headquarters (HQ; centrally located at the LTER research site) is linked to the NMSU network via a 40 MB multi-hop, point-to-point wireless backhaul connection for large-volume data (e.g., streaming meteorological and phenocam data). Field instruments are connected via 900 MHz spread spectrum wireless radios to base stations at HQ. This network allows communication with dataloggers and other research devices to be initiated from anywhere with internet access. Wireless internet at HQ is available for JRN LTER use.\n\n\n\nThe JRN IM system consists of several interrelated components providing the critical functionality to create, manage, and distribute research data, metadata, and ancillary information. The lead IM maintains a public GitHub organization (Jornada-IM) with repositories documenting the structure, standards, and procedures of the JRN IM system, and where the IM team develops data management software tools. The important components of the JRN IM system are described below with explanations of how they are accessible to the public. The JRN IM system integrates with all stages of the DataOne data life cycle, which are identified in parentheses in section headings below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A simplified schematic of the JRN Information Management system. All activity and data occurring on local infrastructure (in yellow folders) is managed directly by the IM Team.\n\n\n\nData collection and quality assurance (Collect, Assure): Research data generally enters the JRN IM system by one of four routes: (1) entry of long-term datasets manually collected by the 4-person JRN field crew, (2) autonomous data collection by sensor networks and dataloggers maintained by the JRN field crew, (3) data submission by LTER investigators and students, or (4) data submission by collaborators not directly managed by JRN. For data category (1), data are collected on a schedule that varies depending on the project, and the manager Anderson is responsible for archiving raw files, data entry/transcription, and production of quality controlled files suitable for publication. To optimize efficiency, custom applications (in Excel and MATLAB) automate quality control at the time of data entry/transcription. For (2), we have adopted the MATLAB GCE Toolbox (developed at GCE LTER) for data QA/QC and publishing, and we are extending its functionality with a human-assisted ML approach developed by Anderson and Ramirez. JRN also uses the USDA-developed DIMA database installed on field tablets, which permits data quality control at the time of collection. For data category (3), data collectors are required to submit quality-assured data and metadata to the IM team within a year of research project initiation, and annually thereafter for long-term research. This also applies to graduate students receiving the JRN LTER fellowship. The IM team communicates these requirements directly to PIs and students at JRN meetings and training events. Once data and metadata is submitted, the IM team archives and applies an additional layer of quality control with custom R scripts during the data publishing phase (Fig. 1). For data category (4), collaborators not directly involved with JRN, we provide access to data standards and archival storage upon request. For example, JRN LTER has been instrumental in developing data standards in the emerging Long-Term Agroecosystems Network (Spiegal et al. 2019).\nData packaging and publishing (Describe, Preserve): A primary function of the JRN IM system is to create and distribute research data packages, consisting of quality-assured data and detailed metadata, to public, online data repositories (primarily EDI). There is considerable variety in data type (tabular, spatial, image, etc.), structure (variables, resolution, etc.), and source (long-term monitoring, JRN investigators, cross-site collaborators, etc.) among our data packages. All JRN data packages are therefore documented with detailed metadata by creating an XML metadata file formatted to the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) 2.2 schema. Data packages are then published to the EDI data repository through the Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture system (PASTA+) whenever possible. Data packages held at EDI now constitute the de-facto JRN data catalog (Fig. 1), and the IM team is currently adding any missing and new packages to the repository. For data packages that are more logically archived in public repositories other than EDI (e.g, AmeriFlux), we publish a “metadata only” package at EDI with links to the outside data holding, allowing discovery of all JRN data packages through one catalog. We have published 117 new data packages to EDI since our 2018 panel review (the majority from our many meteorological stations), a 124% increase over the prior 4 years, and we now publish streaming data from 15 weather stations on a monthly schedule (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A plot of JRN’s PASTA+ database activity (knb-lter-jrn scope), including package creation and recurring updates, at the EDI repository since the LTER-VII proposal review. Top panel: Daily actions for all packages (spikes = meteorological data package creation/updates). Bottom panel: Cumulative actions to signature data packages (new met packages excluded). The dashed line shows our goal to update our entire signature data inventory in the first 2 years of LTER-VII.\n\n\n\nAt the time of data package publication, the IM team error-checks data, outputs the data to an accepted format, and generates an EML file. Metadata in the EML file is populated according to LTER Network best practices, using the LTER Controlled Vocabulary and Standard Units Dictionary, and according to the JRN IM team’s own metadata standards (documented and under development at the Jornada-IM GitHub organization). The IM team consults with data providers during this process to ensure that complete, accurate, and high-quality metadata are obtained. EML creation is accomplished using custom R scripts that use the EMLassemblyline and EML packages for R (developed by EDI and rOpenSci, respectively). Upon upload of EML and associated data entities to EDI, the consistency and integrity of JRN data and metadata is checked by the PASTA+ system. Following upload, data and metadata files for all data packages are archived in a secure network share in the format suggested for the EMLassemblyline package (Fig. 1).\nThe JRN website (Plan, Discover): The JRN website (https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu) is the central means of exposing our research, education, and outreach activities to JRN scientists and staff, external collaborators, and the public in an accessible and user-friendly way. It is a clearinghouse for JRN information and the gateway for discovery of and access to JRN data. Computing resources and software powering the website are described in Table 1, and are primarily maintained by USDA staff, under the supervision of the JRN IM team and PIs. Key elements of the JRN website are:\n\nSite background and current research: The combined research history at JRN LTER and USDA JER reaches back over a century (1915), and JRN has numerous ongoing long- and short-term research and monitoring projects. This complex scientific enterprise can be challenging to communicate to new personnel, collaborators, data users, and the public. For this reason, site descriptions, research vignettes, maps, instructions for new researchers, and other interpretive materials are made available on the JRN website. These materials are periodically revised and updated to reflect new research results and priorities, or other developments.\nData catalog: The JRN data catalog can be browsed and searched with the data catalog tool on the JRN website, which links directly to package landing pages on EDI. The website data catalog queries the EDI repository using the PASTA+ API, meaning search results from the website data catalog always reflect the current JRN holdings on EDI.\nPersonnel database: The JRN personnel database is maintained on the website. Personnel records in the database store position and funding details, contact information, publication lists, and biographical details, and are updated twice yearly at a minimum. Cooperating staff and scientists in the co-located USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range and outside collaborators all have records in this database.\nPublication list: The IM team manages a bibliography containing all JRN publications (including peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, reports, and theses) using Zotero. New publications are identified through reporting by PIs or the Site Research Manager, annual reports, and Google Scholar searches. The bibliography can be browsed and searched using a tool on the JRN website.\nSynergistic activities and partnerships: The JRN LTER participates in a number of education and outreach initiatives directly and through partnerships. Web pages about workshops and courses, applications and training materials, and cooperative agreements with management agencies or community groups are either hosted directly by or linked to the JRN website.\n\nData access policies (Preserve, Discover): In adherence with the Type I data guidelines described in the LTER Network Access Policy, JRN publishes all research data no later than 2 years after collection or at the time of publication. At present, no Type II data are collected at JRN. Because the JRN LTER conducts research in areas (JER and the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center) accessed by approved visitors, but occasionally also trespassers, detailed spatial location data for sensitive research sites are withheld from public metadata. Locations are available to researchers on request from the IM team. Most JRN data packages are published with the Creative Commons “CCBY” license. The JRN IM system ensures that all packages in the data catalog are publicly accessible in three locations: the JRN website data catalog, the EDI repository (in PASTA+), and the DataOne metadata aggregator through EDI’s membership.\n\n\n\nIM integration with research (Plan, Describe, Integrate, Analyze): The IM team works closely with JRN investigators, students, and collaborating scientists to ensure that their research meets data management standards and obligations. Members of the IM team consult with investigators in the early stages of research projects to design and initiate plans that ensure efficient, accurate, and complete collection of data and metadata. Upon publication, the IM team helps researchers format and revise metadata for addition to the JRN data catalog. The IM team maintains web pages in the Jornada-IM GitHub organization, targeted at JRN researchers, that distribute instructional materials, metadata templates, documentation of the JRN IM system (including this document), and offer tutorials on JRN data access and citation.\nMembers of the IM team participate in JRN research as scientists in several capacities. The lead IM is a member of the JRN Data Science team, which is developing capabilities for the proposed Data Science Integration System (DSIS) system to synthesize and harmonize datasets from different studies and locations across the Jornada Basin. The IM team works directly with investigators in the analysis and interpretation of JRN research data and contributes to JRN publications. The lead IM has latitude to collaborate with LTER Network IMs and scientists in the conception, writing, and publishing of articles in ecological informatics and cross-site synthesis.\nEducation and outreach: The lead IM strives to make sound data management a highly visible priority within the JRN LTER community, and makes every effort to provide data management services, resources, and education to our students, researchers, collaborators, and partners. The JRN IM team endeavors to raise the data literacy of these groups with several events each year. We give data management presentations and organize “metadata parties” at JRN events, such as the Jornada Desert Ecology Short Course, and at invited opportunities with JRN-affiliated lab and student groups at NMSU and the University of Texas-El Paso. A new “Data Bounty Hunters” program will begin in 2020. Instructional materials on metadata, JRN data access, and data citation are being written to complement all these events. The IM team communicates regularly with investigators and graduate students to track research progress, request data and metadata submission, and raise awareness of current and developing LTER Network data management practices and expectations. The co-located USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range supports several applied science and informatics projects (Landscape Data Commons, for example) where future collaborations will enable shared development of informatics tools, best practices, and educational curricula of interest to JRN and the LTER Network. Finally, the IM Team is planning new initiatives with JRN’s outreach partners, including the Asombro Institute for Science Education. These include archiving student research data and contributing to development of data literacy curricula for primary and secondary school students and teachers.\nNetwork participation: Lead IM Maurer actively contributes to the LTER Network’s IM activities in several capacities. Presently, he participates in the LTER IM “Non-tabular data” working group developing best practices for publishing data packages with non-standard data types, including UAV image and hyperspectral data, photographic datasets, ecological models, and genomic data. Maurer has recently begun working with EDI software developers with the goal of contributing bug fixes and improvements to the EMLassemblyline R package. The JRN IM team also participates in a southwest U.S. regional group of LTER sites (JRN, SEV, CAP, and MCM) with nascent plans for regional data management workshops and informatics initiatives slated to begin in August 2020. Future JRN IM work will be presented at conferences, training sessions, the annual IMC meeting, and in peer-reviewed journal articles. The expanded GCE Toolbox using machine learning to QA/QC streaming met station data will be made available to other sites in the near future.\n\n\n\nMilestones in the current funding cycle: Since the probationary LTER award in 2018, JRN has focused its efforts on developing new IM practices compliant with NSF and LTER standards, and on updating the JRN data catalog. Milestones we have reached in the past 18 months include:\n\nDevelopment of new data and metadata content and formatting standards for all JRN data packages.\nPrioritization of JRN data packages for publication to EDI based on three classes: long-term signature, long-term, and short-term.\nUpdated metadata and data (to 2019) for all of JRN’s long-term signature packages on EDI, and ensured they are consistent with our newly developed standards.\nReleased a major revision of our website with updates to interpretive material, the data catalog, and the JRN bibliography.\n\nFuture initiatives: The JRN IM system has become more robust and effective over the past 18 months, approaching our goal that information management at JRN must meet or exceed all LTER Network standards and expectations. In addition to implementing the planned data literacy education and outreach initiatives outlined earlier, the lead IM is working to identify further improvements to the IM system itself. Planned improvements during the next phase of LTER-VII include:\n\nIntegration of research and data management forms and tracking with the JRN website.\nUpdating data and metadata in completed, short-term, student, and other non-signature data packages that currently have lower priority in the JRN data catalog.\nDevelopment of a new metadata database using the LTER-core-metabase schema currently being developed by LTER IMs.\nCreation of new workflows and data management tools to assist in the analysis and publication of our growing catalog of ecological imagery data from UAVs, phenocams, and other platforms.\nContinued development of the data management and analysis capabilities needed for DSIS, including aggregating and harmonizing suites of ecological data, further enhancement and standardization of project metadata, databasing of tabular research data, and development of analytical applications using open-source tools like R and Python."

    "text": "The core goals of the Information Management (IM) system at the Jornada Basin LTER (JRN) are to support and enhance investigations and data collection, and to make data and other scientific products openly accessible to the science community, resource managers, policy makers, and the public. We are meeting these goals by addressing five IM priorities: (1) design and implement efficient systems to collect, quality-assure, document, and archive research data; (2) annotate research data with complete, standardized metadata; (3) timely publication of data and metadata in accepted research data repositories; (4) promote and facilitate discovery and re-use of JRN research data; and (5) advance sound data management and sharing practices at JRN through leadership and educational activities. The lead Information Manager and other staff use diverse technologies to advance these priorities and hold monthly meetings with JRN PIs to allow oversight of IM activities and promote the development of new goals and procedures.\nOwing to IM deficiencies identified in the renewal proposal review, NSF granted JRN a probationary 2-year LTER award (instead of a full 6-year award) in 2018. A key concern was that JRN data packages were not routinely entered and updated in the Environmental Data Initiative’s data repository (EDI). In response, we: (1) hired a new lead IM (Dr. Greg Maurer, started May 1, 2019), who regularly interacts with LTER Network IMs to learn about technologies, standards, and best-practices and then incorporates them into the JRN IM system; (2) focused our efforts over the past 18 months on writing and updating metadata and publishing new data to EDI, prioritizing our signature datasets (long-term, widely used in JRN or LTER network research); (3) developed the 5 IM priorities listed above; (4) created a new website data catalog that is directly synchronized with the JRN catalog at the EDI data repository; (5) updated our bibliography and personnel information and refreshed the look and feel of the JRN website; and (6) improved communication between the IM team and JRN scientists so they will be aware of, and compliant with, NSF, LTER Network, and JRN data policies. We anticipate that recent modifications to our personnel and practices, as described below, have greatly improved JRN data management and will restore our role as a leader in LTER IM in coming years."

    "text": "Personnel: The JRN “IM team” is headed by G. Maurer. Supported at 1.0 FTE by JRN, Maurer brings a combination of ecological research experience and data management skills to the project. He leads a team comprised of a full-time computer programmer with machine learning expertise (Dr. Geovany Ramirez), a full-time project manager (Dr. Nina Joffe), full-time site manager John Anderson, and half-time database analyst Haneen Omari. The USDA contributions to the team include half-time statistician Darren James who assists Maurer and Omari with data quality assurance, metadata preparation, and EDI data package publication. Project manager Joffe is responsible for JRN website content and ensuring a smooth data publishing process for scientists, from study initiation to completion. USDA staff Scott Schrader and Ken Ramsey maintain servers, shared network resources, and the JRN website stack (Table 1). In addition, JRN scientists and staff contribute software tools for data analysis and visualization and share them as links or embedded apps on the JRN website.\nComputing and storage infrastructure: The JRN IT infrastructure aims to provide diverse, secure, and resilient capabilities for storing and serving information needed by JRN personnel, external collaborators, and the public. The JRN LTER is housed in Wooton Hall, headquarters of the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range (JER), on the New Mexico State University (NMSU) campus. A long-standing ARS-LTER agreement allows the JER to provide and manage most of the local computing infrastructure JRN requires (Table 1), including a cluster of 5 servers with a 100TB storage block. From this cluster, a virtual Ubuntu 16.04 server hosts the JRN website, and JRN staff are provided with CIFS shares for networked file storage. Most JRN research data, IM-related metadata and tools, and staff files and documents (e.g., images, equipment manuals, procedures documents) are also stored on these network shares. Other virtual servers on the same cluster provide additional resources used by JRN, including an R Shiny application server and a MySQL database being tested for research data storage. Hardware updates and upgrades are handled by USDA-ARS staff and NMSU’s Information and Communication Technologies Office, with assistance from JRN as needed. All server and network share files are backed up on a 6-hour schedule, and full, system-wide, off-site tape backups occur monthly. Periodic technology transfers that update hardware, software, and file formats ensure long-term data protection against media or format obsolescence. The JRN IM team uses a variety of secure cloud platforms (e.g. Trello, GitHub, and Zotero.org) to store and manage documentation, bibliographies, and other project data. Off-site personnel that cannot use local network shares may store files in Dropbox or Google Drive depending on project needs and institutional requirements for project members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal/remote resource\nSoftware applications\nImplemented service\n\n\n\n\nDell R710 server cluster\nCitrix Xen Hypervisor\nMiscellaneous virtual server hosting\n\n\nDell R710 server cluster\nUbuntu Linux 16.04, Apache HTTP Server, Drupal 7\nJRN website\n\n\nzotero.org, server cluster\nZotero, Javascript, Drupal\nBibliography (on JRN website)\n\n\nEDI, server cluster\nJavascript, Drupal\nData catalog (on JRN website)\n\n\nLocal storage, server cluster\nCIFS\nNetwork file storage (documents, research data, metadata)\n\n\nDropbox, Google Drive\n\nProject document storage and sharing\n\n\n\nTable 1: JRN computing resources, software, and implemented services used for Information Management.\nNetwork infrastructure: Servers and staff computers are connected to a Gigabit local area network (LAN) linked to the NMSU network (Gigabit Ethernet) through a firewall. Local networked systems and web applications are password-protected, and regular security sweeps identify security threats. The USDA Jornada field headquarters (HQ; centrally located at the LTER research site) is linked to the NMSU network via a 40 MB multi-hop, point-to-point wireless backhaul connection for large-volume data (e.g., streaming meteorological and phenocam data). Field instruments are connected via 900 MHz spread spectrum wireless radios to base stations at HQ. This network allows communication with dataloggers and other research devices to be initiated from anywhere with internet access. Wireless internet at HQ is available for JRN LTER use."

    "text": "The JRN IM system consists of several interrelated components providing the critical functionality to create, manage, and distribute research data, metadata, and ancillary information. The lead IM maintains a public GitHub organization (Jornada-IM) with repositories documenting the structure, standards, and procedures of the JRN IM system, and where the IM team develops data management software tools. The important components of the JRN IM system are described below with explanations of how they are accessible to the public. The JRN IM system integrates with all stages of the DataOne data life cycle, which are identified in parentheses in section headings below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A simplified schematic of the JRN Information Management system. All activity and data occurring on local infrastructure (in yellow folders) is managed directly by the IM Team.\n\n\n\nData collection and quality assurance (Collect, Assure): Research data generally enters the JRN IM system by one of four routes: (1) entry of long-term datasets manually collected by the 4-person JRN field crew, (2) autonomous data collection by sensor networks and dataloggers maintained by the JRN field crew, (3) data submission by LTER investigators and students, or (4) data submission by collaborators not directly managed by JRN. For data category (1), data are collected on a schedule that varies depending on the project, and the manager Anderson is responsible for archiving raw files, data entry/transcription, and production of quality controlled files suitable for publication. To optimize efficiency, custom applications (in Excel and MATLAB) automate quality control at the time of data entry/transcription. For (2), we have adopted the MATLAB GCE Toolbox (developed at GCE LTER) for data QA/QC and publishing, and we are extending its functionality with a human-assisted ML approach developed by Anderson and Ramirez. JRN also uses the USDA-developed DIMA database installed on field tablets, which permits data quality control at the time of collection. For data category (3), data collectors are required to submit quality-assured data and metadata to the IM team within a year of research project initiation, and annually thereafter for long-term research. This also applies to graduate students receiving the JRN LTER fellowship. The IM team communicates these requirements directly to PIs and students at JRN meetings and training events. Once data and metadata is submitted, the IM team archives and applies an additional layer of quality control with custom R scripts during the data publishing phase (Fig. 1). For data category (4), collaborators not directly involved with JRN, we provide access to data standards and archival storage upon request. For example, JRN LTER has been instrumental in developing data standards in the emerging Long-Term Agroecosystems Network (Spiegal et al. 2019).\nData packaging and publishing (Describe, Preserve): A primary function of the JRN IM system is to create and distribute research data packages, consisting of quality-assured data and detailed metadata, to public, online data repositories (primarily EDI). There is considerable variety in data type (tabular, spatial, image, etc.), structure (variables, resolution, etc.), and source (long-term monitoring, JRN investigators, cross-site collaborators, etc.) among our data packages. All JRN data packages are therefore documented with detailed metadata by creating an XML metadata file formatted to the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) 2.2 schema. Data packages are then published to the EDI data repository through the Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture system (PASTA+) whenever possible. Data packages held at EDI now constitute the de-facto JRN data catalog (Fig. 1), and the IM team is currently adding any missing and new packages to the repository. For data packages that are more logically archived in public repositories other than EDI (e.g, AmeriFlux), we publish a “metadata only” package at EDI with links to the outside data holding, allowing discovery of all JRN data packages through one catalog. We have published 117 new data packages to EDI since our 2018 panel review (the majority from our many meteorological stations), a 124% increase over the prior 4 years, and we now publish streaming data from 15 weather stations on a monthly schedule (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A plot of JRN’s PASTA+ database activity (knb-lter-jrn scope), including package creation and recurring updates, at the EDI repository since the LTER-VII proposal review. Top panel: Daily actions for all packages (spikes = meteorological data package creation/updates). Bottom panel: Cumulative actions to signature data packages (new met packages excluded). The dashed line shows our goal to update our entire signature data inventory in the first 2 years of LTER-VII.\n\n\n\nAt the time of data package publication, the IM team error-checks data, outputs the data to an accepted format, and generates an EML file. Metadata in the EML file is populated according to LTER Network best practices, using the LTER Controlled Vocabulary and Standard Units Dictionary, and according to the JRN IM team’s own metadata standards (documented and under development at the Jornada-IM GitHub organization). The IM team consults with data providers during this process to ensure that complete, accurate, and high-quality metadata are obtained. EML creation is accomplished using custom R scripts that use the EMLassemblyline and EML packages for R (developed by EDI and rOpenSci, respectively). Upon upload of EML and associated data entities to EDI, the consistency and integrity of JRN data and metadata is checked by the PASTA+ system. Following upload, data and metadata files for all data packages are archived in a secure network share in the format suggested for the EMLassemblyline package (Fig. 1).\nThe JRN website (Plan, Discover): The JRN website (https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu) is the central means of exposing our research, education, and outreach activities to JRN scientists and staff, external collaborators, and the public in an accessible and user-friendly way. It is a clearinghouse for JRN information and the gateway for discovery of and access to JRN data. Computing resources and software powering the website are described in Table 1, and are primarily maintained by USDA staff, under the supervision of the JRN IM team and PIs. Key elements of the JRN website are:\n\nSite background and current research: The combined research history at JRN LTER and USDA JER reaches back over a century (1915), and JRN has numerous ongoing long- and short-term research and monitoring projects. This complex scientific enterprise can be challenging to communicate to new personnel, collaborators, data users, and the public. For this reason, site descriptions, research vignettes, maps, instructions for new researchers, and other interpretive materials are made available on the JRN website. These materials are periodically revised and updated to reflect new research results and priorities, or other developments.\nData catalog: The JRN data catalog can be browsed and searched with the data catalog tool on the JRN website, which links directly to package landing pages on EDI. The website data catalog queries the EDI repository using the PASTA+ API, meaning search results from the website data catalog always reflect the current JRN holdings on EDI.\nPersonnel database: The JRN personnel database is maintained on the website. Personnel records in the database store position and funding details, contact information, publication lists, and biographical details, and are updated twice yearly at a minimum. Cooperating staff and scientists in the co-located USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range and outside collaborators all have records in this database.\nPublication list: The IM team manages a bibliography containing all JRN publications (including peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, reports, and theses) using Zotero. New publications are identified through reporting by PIs or the Site Research Manager, annual reports, and Google Scholar searches. The bibliography can be browsed and searched using a tool on the JRN website.\nSynergistic activities and partnerships: The JRN LTER participates in a number of education and outreach initiatives directly and through partnerships. Web pages about workshops and courses, applications and training materials, and cooperative agreements with management agencies or community groups are either hosted directly by or linked to the JRN website.\n\nData access policies (Preserve, Discover): In adherence with the Type I data guidelines described in the LTER Network Access Policy, JRN publishes all research data no later than 2 years after collection or at the time of publication. At present, no Type II data are collected at JRN. Because the JRN LTER conducts research in areas (JER and the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center) accessed by approved visitors, but occasionally also trespassers, detailed spatial location data for sensitive research sites are withheld from public metadata. Locations are available to researchers on request from the IM team. Most JRN data packages are published with the Creative Commons “CCBY” license. The JRN IM system ensures that all packages in the data catalog are publicly accessible in three locations: the JRN website data catalog, the EDI repository (in PASTA+), and the DataOne metadata aggregator through EDI’s membership."

    "text": "version 0.4\n\n\nThe Jornada Basin LTER program (JRN) supports an effective and well-integrated information management (IM) program and shares the LTER Network view that published datasets are first-class products of research and an opportunity for outreach and education. The JRN Information Management (IM) system reliably performs a full range of essential data management functions to make research data and other information produced by the JRN program findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable (FAIR, Wilkinson et al. 2016). The team that designs and operates this system is guided by three core priorities.\n\nContribute to high quality, impactful ecology research at all stages of the data life cycle\nOversee, or directly handle, publication of all Jornada datasets\nAct as a source of data-related leadership, education, and outreach\n\nThe JRN IM team approaches each of these priorities with a philosophy of openness to diverse stakeholders, including scientists, resource managers, students, & the public, and a commitment to the principles of open scientific research. In this Data Management Plan, we review recent progress in JRN IM, and outline the strategy for managing and publishing JRN research data from 2025 to 2030.\n\n\n\nPersonnel: The JRN IM team is headed by Dr. Gregory Maurer, supported at 0.5 FTE by JRN. He leads a team comprised of a part-time computer programmer and part-time undergraduate assistants who contribute to data QA/QC, website content, and communications. The IM team works closely with JRN’s full-time site manager and program coordinator, and also collaborates closely with USDA data managers, including statistician Darren James, and local computing and network infrastructure managers Scott Schrader and Ken Ramsey. Maurer meets at least monthly with the JRN leadership team to align IM activities with research priorities, convey updates, and take feedback on data management standards and procedures.\nComputing and storage infrastructure: The JRN IM system is built on multiple technologies and infrastructure resources that provide secure, resilient computing and storage capabilities for JRN personnel, external collaborators, and the public. Most members of the JRN IM team have offices in Wooton Hall, headquarters of the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range (JER), on New Mexico State University (NMSU) campus. A long-standing ARS-LTER agreement allows the JER to provide and manage some of the computing infrastructure that JRN requires (Table 1), including a server cluster with a 100TB storage block from which JRN staff are provided with networked file storage shares. Research data, IM-related metadata and tools, and staff files and documents (e.g., images, equipment manuals, procedures documents) are stored on these shares. Most other JRN IM infrastructure has transitioned to cloud-based systems in the last four years (Table 1) to reduce physical infrastructure maintenance demands and increase reliability and uptime. Linux virtual machines and S3-compatible object stores at DigitalOcean.com host databases with research metadata and other information (PostgreSQL 12), web-accessible storage for data entities, and full offsite backups of local Jornada file storage. The JRN website is built with WordPress and has several associated Javascript data catalog and bibliography applications, all of which are hosted at WPengine.com. Data catalogs and bibliography apps rely on API access to data stores at the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) repository, Zotero.org, and NMSU’s ArcGIS Online instance. The JRN website’s interactive data viewer is hosted at the USDA-ARS-supported Shinyapps.io account. All cloud-based systems have a minimum of nightly backups with distributed storage and rollback ability. The JRN IM team backs up all shared local files nightly to an in-house device and the DigitalOcean S3 bucket, which is in addition to weekly, off-site tape-drive backups of the same data performed by USDA-ARS staff. Technology transfers update hardware, software, and file formats on a 3-5 year cycle to ensure long-term data protection against media or format obsolescence. Depending on project needs and institutional requirements, the IM team and researchers use a variety of secure cloud platforms (e.g. Trello, GitHub, Dropbox or Google Drive) for online collaboration and storage of documentation, code, and other project information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplemented service\nLocal/remote infrastructure\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nNetworked file storage on NMSU campus\n100TB local storage block\nCIFS\n\n\nLTER-core-metabase metadata database\nDigitalOcean.com VM\nUbuntu Linux 20.04, PostgreSQL 12.16\n\n\nWeb-accessible data storage, offsite backups\nDigitalOcean.com Spaces\nS3-compatible object store\n\n\nJRN website and associated app hosting\nWPengine.com\nWordpress 6\n\n\nEDI data catalog app (JRN website)\nportal.edirepository.org\nPASTA+ API, Javascript\n\n\nBibliography, non-EDI data catalog apps (JRN website)\nZotero.org\nZotero API, Javascript\n\n\nInteractive data viewer (JRN website)\nShinyapps.io\nR Shiny (Javascript app builder)\n\n\nDocument storage/sharing for remote collaboration\nDropbox, Google Drive, GitHub\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The information technology services used by JRN, along with the associated local or remote infrastructure and softwares responsible for implementing them.\nNetwork infrastructure: Servers and staff computers at Wooton Hall are connected to a Gigabit local area network (LAN) linked to the NMSU network (Gigabit Ethernet) through a firewall. Local networked systems and web applications are password-protected, and regular security sweeps identify security threats. The USDA Jornada field headquarters (HQ; centrally located at the LTER research site) is linked to the NMSU network via a 40 MB multi-hop, point-to-point wireless backhaul connection that can accommodate large-volume data. Field instruments are connected via spread spectrum wireless radios to base stations and the internet at HQ. Wireless internet at HQ is available for JRN LTER use.\n\n\n\nJornada data management practices must accommodate diverse research activities and data products, ranging from tabular field data, to ground-based and airborne imagery, to ecological model outputs, to data from specimen and sample collections. The JRN IM system therefore uses several infrastructure components and procedures to create, manage, and distribute research data and other information in a modular way. Wherever possible the JRN IM team uses open-source tools and community standards. All documentation for the system is available in the group’s public GitHub organization (https://github.com/jornada-im), along with instructional materials for data-related education and outreach. Essential functions that the IM system delivers, with relevant components and processes, are described below. Stages of the DataONE data life cycle are identified in parentheses after section headings.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A simplified schematic of the JRN Information Management system.

All dashed arrows involve some scripting and automation.

Most data products from JRN projects are tabular in nature, and there are three primary entry points for this data into the JRN IM system: (1) collection of long-term datasets by the 3-person JRN field crew and site manager Anderson, (2) autonomous data collection by sensor networks and dataloggers, and (3) data submission by LTER investigators, students, and collaborators. For data entry point (1), field data collection schedules vary depending on the project, and site manager Anderson is responsible for archiving raw files and managing data entry/transcription and validation procedures. Anderson works closely with the rest of the IM team to quality assure and check (QA/QC) new data and produce files suitable for publication on an annual basis. To optimize efficiency, the IM team has developed custom workflows (in R, Python, Matlab, or Excel) to assist with QA/QC and generate output files. For entry point (2) we use the MATLAB GCE Toolbox (developed at GCE LTER) for data QA/QC, and have extended its functionality to allow rapid data flagging and publication to EDI using software developed by Ramirez and Anderson. For entry point (3), students and investigators QA/QC their own data and submit it with appropriate metadata to the IM team on a timeframe matching JRN and LTER data access policies (see below). Once data and metadata are submitted to the IM team, an additional layer of QA/QC and standardization is applied through database validation and custom R scripts (Fig. 1) during the data publication phase.\nThere are several classes of specialized JRN data products, including large datasets and non-tabular formats, that require a flexible approach to quality assurance. Biological specimens and physical samples destined for scientific collections are not assessed or otherwise handled directly by the IM team. Sequencing and genomic research generates datasets that are best assessed by those trained in bioinformatics. JRN modeling activities generate rapidly evolving code and parameter sets, and voluminous output/simulation data. Similarly, large collections of ground-based or airborne imagery are generated by multiple JRN research efforts. In each of these cases the JRN IM team has limited capacity to directly QA/QC the data. Instead, the focus is on training and coordination with the responsible researchers to ensure data quality and security, and collection of appropriate, descriptive metadata.\nData packaging and publishing (Describe, Preserve): To meet the FAIR data criteria, JRN strives to publish quality-assured data accompanied by rich, detailed metadata. Creating and publishing new datasets begins with submission of metadata using EDI’s ezEML tool, or a metadata template created by the IM team (MS Word or Excel formats). The IM team consults closely with researchers, students, and staff to determine what constitutes a useful dataset and how to describe one with metadata. Upon submission, the IM team stores and manages metadata for all tabular data products in a relational database following the LTER-core-metabase schema (metabase hereafter) which is maintained by a working group of the LTER Network Information Management Committee (IMC). This system validates and enforces standards, such as use of the LTER Controlled Vocabulary and Standard Units Dictionary, for incoming metadata. JRN also uses its own set of metadata standards and controlled vocabularies developed in consultation with Jornada researchers.\nThe JRN IM team publishes datasets in community-accepted online data repositories, with most going to the EDI data repository, which is closely affiliated with the LTER Network and focuses on metadata standards and data re-use. Before publication, the IM team error-checks and formats data files for usability, then uses an R-based workflow (MetaEgress and jerald packages) to extract metadata from metabase and generate an XML file formatted to the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) 2.2 standard. Data and EML files are then published together in EDI’s Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture system (PASTA+). The consistency and integrity of all data and metadata is checked again by the PASTA+ system upon entering the repository. Datasets held at EDI constitute the primary JRN data catalog (Fig. 1), but some JRN data products are published elsewhere.\nSpecialized data products often have unique, community-standard data formats and metadata, and may benefit from alternative repository systems and publication methods. The IM team encourages and facilitates publication to non-EDI data repositories when logical to do so, and there are significant JRN data holdings in NCBI databases (sequencing and genomic data), AmeriFlux (flux towers), and the Phenocam network. Citation metadata for products in these repositories are entered into a Zotero library and listed in JRN’s non-EDI data catalog. In JRN-8 the IM team will begin placing new high-volume datasets (UAS imagery, acoustic monitoring data, model training data) into offline storage and making metadata records available in EDI. In all these cases the JRN IM team prioritizes providing high-quality metadata to allow others to discover the data, wherever it may reside, and assess its quality and fitness for use.\nFor specimens and samples collected during JRN research (a new data management focus), the IM team collaborates with investigators to identify suitable partner museums or natural history collections, assemble appropriate metadata, and then accession the physical items into the collection, and metadata into an accessible database (e.g. Arctos, Symbiota). Plant and vertebrate voucher specimens are currently sent to the NMSU Herbaria and NMSU Wildlife Museums, respectively, and less-frequently collected specimens, like invertebrates, have been accessioned into a range of other collections in the past. Decades of Jornada soil survey and pedology samples have been archived at the NRCS National Soil Archive. When accessioning specimens and samples into established collections is not possible, the JRN IM team ensures stable local storage, catalogs all appropriate metadata, and makes the collection accessible on the JRN website. Some physical samples, including aeolian dust, atmospheric deposition, and plant tissue samples, are already handled this way. In recent years at JRN, environmental samples like soils, biocrusts, tissues, fecal pellets, and DNA extracts are being collected for metabarcoding, metagenomics, and other sequencing-based methods of investigation. Most of these are currently archived in investigator or departmental laboratory facilities (-80 freezers). In JRN-8, the IM team is proposing new protocols to handle these samples and associated data; see item 4 under “Future initiatives” below.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A plot of JRN’s PASTA+ database activity (knb-lter-jrn scope) at the EDI repository since the 2020 JRN-8 proposal submission.

Panel A: Cumulative dataset creation and update events. Panel B: Daily data downloads for JRN datasets. Known robots have been removed. \n\n\n\nData archiving and access policies (Preserve, Discover): In adherence with the Type I data guidelines described in the LTER Network Data Access Policy, JRN strives to publish all research data no more than 2 years after collection or at the time of journal article publication. Long-term core research datasets are prioritized highest for publication within this 2 year period, while student thesis data receive lower publication priority as students finish, and datasets from early, previously unpublished JRN studies are published as time allows. To ensure compliance with this policy, JRN strongly encourages timely submission and archiving of research data from all supported projects. Investigators and students, particularly those receiving JRN graduate fellowships or other funds, are required to submit data to the IM team within a year of research project initiation, and annually thereafter for long-term research. The IM team regularly communicates these requirements directly to PIs and students at JRN meetings and training events. At present, no Type II data are collected at JRN.\nData published in the primary JRN data catalog are publicly accessible in three locations: the JRN website, EDI, and the DataONE metadata aggregator through EDI’s membership. Almost all JRN datasets are published with the Creative Commons “CCBY” or “CC0” license, with minor exceptions for JRN data published in non-EDI repositories (e.g. NCBI). Detailed spatial data for research sites and instrumentation in areas accessible to the public (JER and the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center) are withheld from public metadata but are available to researchers upon request.\nThe JRN website (Plan, Discover): The JRN website (https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu) is the central means of exposing all aspects of research, education, and outreach activities in an accessible and user-friendly way. It conveys this information through a mix of static and interactive pages featuring site and program descriptions, blog posts, maps, research vignettes, and other materials. Website information is updated regularly and designed for effective communication with JRN scientists, staff, external collaborators, and the public.\nThe JRN website has two main data-related functions. First, it directly communicates important information about collecting and sharing data to JRN researchers and staff. The “For Researchers” menu covers important topics such as (a) procedures for initiating new research, (b) site and field safety information, (c) conduct and inclusive research expectations, (d) incident reporting, and (e) expectations and procedures for contributing Jornada data, specimens, and samples. The IM team ensures that this content is accessible, clear, and actionable. Second, the website is the gateway for discovery and access to JRN data. The website data catalog is multi-faceted and includes capable browsing and search tools. The primary website data catalog queries the EDI repository using the PASTA+ API and returns results that link directly to dataset landing pages on EDI, meaning that the data catalog always reflects current JRN holdings on EDI. Other facets of the data catalog allow discovery of non-EDI datasets, spatial data, biological specimens and physical samples, and data available from JRN’s non-LTER research partners.\nAccess to JRN publication and personnel listings is provided via website applications as well. For publications, an LTER-community maintained javascript application provides access to a Zotero.org-backed JRN bibliography of peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, reports, and theses. Current JRN personnel are featured on the website using a WordPress plugin, which the IM team populates from an extensive personnel database that reaches back to the beginning of the program.\n\n\n\nIM integration with research (Plan, Describe, Integrate, Analyze): The IM team is composed of experienced ecologists, statisticians, and computer scientists (and students in these fields) who contribute to JRN research in a range of scientific capacities. They work closely with Jornada investigators to ensure that research projects are soundly designed, address high-priority JRN research objectives, and meet all open science and data management standards and obligations. For new research, IM involvement typically begins early in the project approval process or during proposal writing efforts, allowing IMs to consider any unique data demands and initiate sound data management procedures. The IM team regularly contributes to research using JRN’s long-term core datasets, and therefore has a valuable perspective for overseeing these important projects. Recently, for example, the IM team led an effort to evaluate JRN’s long-term plant phenology data and revise the observation program to match National Phenology Network and NEON protocols (Elmendorf et al. 2016). Members of the IM team also manage their own research projects, advise JRN students and investigators, and contribute to journal articles.\nEducation and outreach: The JRN IM team prioritizes data-related leadership, education, and outreach by promoting the importance of Jornada data and sound data management practices, and building the data literacy and skills of Jornada investigators, students, and staff. Maurer and James are certified Carpentries instructors and have organized five scientific programming and data analysis workshops in the past 3 years. At the annual Jornada Desert Ecology Short Course, the IM team delivers a detailed Jornada Information Management presentation to students and researchers, and organizes ad-hoc events such as Data Jams (with Asombro), metadata clinics, or Carpentries workshops. Maurer holds weekly data-related office hours (Data Therapy Thursday) and James holds a monthly R work group.\nNetwork participation: Members of the JRN IM team actively contribute to the LTER Network’s IM activities in several capacities. From 2020-2023, Maurer served on the IM Executive committee for the network, including a term as co-chair, and he currently leads or participates in several EDI/LTER working groups. JRN contributes code, data, and expertise to several EDI and LTER data synthesis projects and collaborates closely with IMs from SEV, MCM, and NWT to organize education and outreach activities.\n\n\n\nMilestones in the current funding cycle: Since its last LTER renewal in 2018, JRN has developed a more efficient data publishing system, eased discovery and access of its diverse datasets, and enhanced data reusability by standardizing data and metadata. Milestones from the past four years include:\n\nA total of 386 JRN datasets are published at the EDI repository, with 291 newly created since the renewal, including many previously unpublished datasets from early JRN LTER projects. More than 330 datasets had data and/or metadata updated at least once in this period, with most long-term core datasets being updated yearly, and as frequently as monthly for over 30 weather station datasets (Fig. 2).\nWe created metabase and populated it with the rich metadata Jornada research programs have accumulated over the past 40 years. This system eased implementation of new data formatting and metadata content standards for almost all datasets in the JRN data catalog.\nNew standards and workflows to manage and publish specialized (non-tabular) datasets, such as ground-based and airborne imagery, were developed in collaboration with data managers in the LTER network and beyond (Gries et al. 2021).\nThe JRN data catalog was revised to enhance discovery and access to: (a) data published outside of EDI, (b) geospatial data, and (c), data from collaborating research networks and partners.\n\nFuture initiatives: The IM team will continue making steady improvements to the JRN IM system and the quality and FAIR status of JRN data. The next six years will bring significant changes to JRN research priorities and data, and the IM team plans to support these transitions. Planned improvements during JRN-8 are:\n\nThe IM team will expand its focus on the re-use of JRN data by harmonizing datasets, creating analysis-ready data products, and developing analytical applications. We will use open-source tools like R and Python, and leverage recent improvements in JRN metadata standards and publishing efficiency.\nJRN research projects continue to expand data collection via sensor networks. The IM team will extend the use of the MATLAB GCE Toolbox by implementing a new time series database for these data, and open-source tools to manage, publish, and access them efficiently. A pilot project for this began in 2023 in coordination with the HyMet working group, a joint effort of the LTER Network, EDI, CUAHSI, and the Dendra project. A side benefit of this work will be accessibility of real-time information about field conditions that will improve researcher safety.\nSeveral JRN-8 projects propose to collect and use ground-based and aerial imagery (e.g. phenocams, UAS imagery) as a survey and monitoring method to complement or replace manual fieldwork. The IM team will respond with suitable data management protocols and accessibility tools.\nAs noted above, biological specimens and physical samples are a key product of JRN research. In JRN-8, the IM team will work to (a) identify JRN physical sample and specimen collections and make a comprehensive catalog accessible via the JRN website, and (b) develop new protocols to preserve and archive scientifically useful environmental samples (soil, biocrust, tissues), or resulting DNA extracts, into appropriate collections. For (b) we are discussing partnership options with the Museum of Southwestern Biology and the NEON Biorepository, and examining supplemental funding opportunities.\nThe Jornada Dryland Modeling team is proposing ecological modeling capabilities that will (a) consume observational datasets and other training data, (b) undergo intensive software development over time, and (c) produce simulation outputs for a variety of research questions and applications. The JRN IM team is embedded in this effort and will ensure that modeling activity and relevant data products are preserved and publicly accessible."

The JRN Information Management (IM) system reliably performs a full range of essential data management functions to make research data and other information produced by the JRN program findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-usable (FAIR, Wilkinson et al. 2016). The team that designs and operates this system is guided by three core priorities.\n\nContribute to high quality, impactful ecology research at all stages of the data life cycle\nOversee, or directly handle, publication of all Jornada datasets\nAct as a source of data-related leadership, education, and outreach\n\nThe JRN IM team approaches each of these priorities with a philosophy of openness to diverse stakeholders, including scientists, resource managers, students, & the public, and a commitment to the principles of open scientific research. In this Data Management Plan, we review recent progress in JRN IM, and outline the strategy for managing and publishing JRN research data from 2025 to 2030."

    "text": "Personnel: The JRN IM team is headed by Dr. Gregory Maurer, supported at 0.5 FTE by JRN. He leads a team comprised of a part-time computer programmer and part-time undergraduate assistants who contribute to data QA/QC, website content, and communications. The IM team works closely with JRN’s full-time site manager and program coordinator, and also collaborates closely with USDA data managers, including statistician Darren James, and local computing and network infrastructure managers Scott Schrader and Ken Ramsey. Maurer meets at least monthly with the JRN leadership team to align IM activities with research priorities, convey updates, and take feedback on data management standards and procedures.\nComputing and storage infrastructure: The JRN IM system is built on multiple technologies and infrastructure resources that provide secure, resilient computing and storage capabilities for JRN personnel, external collaborators, and the public. Most members of the JRN IM team have offices in Wooton Hall, headquarters of the USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range (JER), on New Mexico State University (NMSU) campus. A long-standing ARS-LTER agreement allows the JER to provide and manage some of the computing infrastructure that JRN requires (Table 1), including a server cluster with a 100TB storage block from which JRN staff are provided with networked file storage shares. Research data, IM-related metadata and tools, and staff files and documents (e.g., images, equipment manuals, procedures documents) are stored on these shares. Most other JRN IM infrastructure has transitioned to cloud-based systems in the last four years (Table 1) to reduce physical infrastructure maintenance demands and increase reliability and uptime. Linux virtual machines and S3-compatible object stores at DigitalOcean.com host databases with research metadata and other information (PostgreSQL 12), web-accessible storage for data entities, and full offsite backups of local Jornada file storage. The JRN website is built with WordPress and has several associated Javascript data catalog and bibliography applications, all of which are hosted at WPengine.com. Data catalogs and bibliography apps rely on API access to data stores at the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) repository, Zotero.org, and NMSU’s ArcGIS Online instance. The JRN website’s interactive data viewer is hosted at the USDA-ARS-supported Shinyapps.io account. All cloud-based systems have a minimum of nightly backups with distributed storage and rollback ability. The JRN IM team backs up all shared local files nightly to an in-house device and the DigitalOcean S3 bucket, which is in addition to weekly, off-site tape-drive backups of the same data performed by USDA-ARS staff. Technology transfers update hardware, software, and file formats on a 3-5 year cycle to ensure long-term data protection against media or format obsolescence. Depending on project needs and institutional requirements, the IM team and researchers use a variety of secure cloud platforms (e.g. Trello, GitHub, Dropbox or Google Drive) for online collaboration and storage of documentation, code, and other project information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplemented service\nLocal/remote infrastructure\nSoftware\n\n\n\n\nNetworked file storage on NMSU campus\n100TB local storage block\nCIFS\n\n\nLTER-core-metabase metadata database\nDigitalOcean.com VM\nUbuntu Linux 20.04, PostgreSQL 12.16\n\n\nWeb-accessible data storage, offsite backups\nDigitalOcean.com Spaces\nS3-compatible object store\n\n\nJRN website and associated app hosting\nWPengine.com\nWordpress 6\n\n\nEDI data catalog app (JRN website)\nportal.edirepository.org\nPASTA+ API, Javascript\n\n\nBibliography, non-EDI data catalog apps (JRN website)\nZotero.org\nZotero API, Javascript\n\n\nInteractive data viewer (JRN website)\nShinyapps.io\nR Shiny (Javascript app builder)\n\n\nDocument storage/sharing for remote collaboration\nDropbox, Google Drive, GitHub\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The information technology services used by JRN, along with the associated local or remote infrastructure and softwares responsible for implementing them.\nNetwork infrastructure: Servers and staff computers at Wooton Hall are connected to a Gigabit local area network (LAN) linked to the NMSU network (Gigabit Ethernet) through a firewall. Local networked systems and web applications are password-protected, and regular security sweeps identify security threats. The USDA Jornada field headquarters (HQ; centrally located at the LTER research site) is linked to the NMSU network via a 40 MB multi-hop, point-to-point wireless backhaul connection that can accommodate large-volume data. Field instruments are connected via spread spectrum wireless radios to base stations and the internet at HQ. Wireless internet at HQ is available for JRN LTER use."

To ensure compliance with this policy, JRN strongly encourages timely submission and archiving of research data from all supported projects. Investigators and students, particularly those receiving JRN graduate fellowships or other funds, are required to submit data to the IM team within a year of research project initiation, and annually thereafter for long-term research. The IM team regularly communicates these requirements directly to PIs and students at JRN meetings and training events. At present, no Type II data are collected at JRN.\nData published in the primary JRN data catalog are publicly accessible in three locations: the JRN website, EDI, and the DataONE metadata aggregator through EDI’s membership. Almost all JRN datasets are published with the Creative Commons “CCBY” or “CC0” license, with minor exceptions for JRN data published in non-EDI repositories (e.g. NCBI). Detailed spatial data for research sites and instrumentation in areas accessible to the public (JER and the Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center) are withheld from public metadata but are available to researchers upon request.\nThe JRN website (Plan, Discover): The JRN website (https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu) is the central means of exposing all aspects of research, education, and outreach activities in an accessible and user-friendly way. It conveys this information through a mix of static and interactive pages featuring site and program descriptions, blog posts, maps, research vignettes, and other materials. Website information is updated regularly and designed for effective communication with JRN scientists, staff, external collaborators, and the public.\nThe JRN website has two main data-related functions. First, it directly communicates important information about collecting and sharing data to JRN researchers and staff. The “For Researchers” menu covers important topics such as (a) procedures for initiating new research, (b) site and field safety information, (c) conduct and inclusive research expectations, (d) incident reporting, and (e) expectations and procedures for contributing Jornada data, specimens, and samples. The IM team ensures that this content is accessible, clear, and actionable. Second, the website is the gateway for discovery and access to JRN data. The website data catalog is multi-faceted and includes capable browsing and search tools. The primary website data catalog queries the EDI repository using the PASTA+ API and returns results that link directly to dataset landing pages on EDI, meaning that the data catalog always reflects current JRN holdings on EDI. Other facets of the data catalog allow discovery of non-EDI datasets, spatial data, biological specimens and physical samples, and data available from JRN’s non-LTER research partners.\nAccess to JRN publication and personnel listings is provided via website applications as well. For publications, an LTER-community maintained javascript application provides access to a Zotero.org-backed JRN bibliography of peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters, reports, and theses. Current JRN personnel are featured on the website using a WordPress plugin, which the IM team populates from an extensive personnel database that reaches back to the beginning of the program."

    "text": "IM integration with research (Plan, Describe, Integrate, Analyze): The IM team is composed of experienced ecologists, statisticians, and computer scientists (and students in these fields) who contribute to JRN research in a range of scientific capacities. They work closely with Jornada investigators to ensure that research projects are soundly designed, address high-priority JRN research objectives, and meet all open science and data management standards and obligations. For new research, IM involvement typically begins early in the project approval process or during proposal writing efforts, allowing IMs to consider any unique data demands and initiate sound data management procedures. The IM team regularly contributes to research using JRN’s long-term core datasets, and therefore has a valuable perspective for overseeing these important projects. Recently, for example, the IM team led an effort to evaluate JRN’s long-term plant phenology data and revise the observation program to match National Phenology Network and NEON protocols (Elmendorf et al. 2016). Members of the IM team also manage their own research projects, advise JRN students and investigators, and contribute to journal articles.\nEducation and outreach: The JRN IM team prioritizes data-related leadership, education, and outreach by promoting the importance of Jornada data and sound data management practices, and building the data literacy and skills of Jornada investigators, students, and staff. Maurer and James are certified Carpentries instructors and have organized five scientific programming and data analysis workshops in the past 3 years. At the annual Jornada Desert Ecology Short Course, the IM team delivers a detailed Jornada Information Management presentation to students and researchers, and organizes ad-hoc events such as Data Jams (with Asombro), metadata clinics, or Carpentries workshops. Maurer holds weekly data-related office hours (Data Therapy Thursday) and James holds a monthly R work group.\nNetwork participation: Members of the JRN IM team actively contribute to the LTER Network’s IM activities in several capacities. From 2020-2023, Maurer served on the IM Executive committee for the network, including a term as co-chair, and he currently leads or participates in several EDI/LTER working groups. JRN contributes code, data, and expertise to several EDI and LTER data synthesis projects and collaborates closely with IMs from SEV, MCM, and NWT to organize education and outreach activities."

    "text": "Milestones in the current funding cycle: Since its last LTER renewal in 2018, JRN has developed a more efficient data publishing system, eased discovery and access of its diverse datasets, and enhanced data reusability by standardizing data and metadata. Milestones from the past four years include:\n\nA total of 386 JRN datasets are published at the EDI repository, with 291 newly created since the renewal, including many previously unpublished datasets from early JRN LTER projects. More than 330 datasets had data and/or metadata updated at least once in this period, with most long-term core datasets being updated yearly, and as frequently as monthly for over 30 weather station datasets (Fig. 2).\nWe created metabase and populated it with the rich metadata Jornada research programs have accumulated over the past 40 years. This system eased implementation of new data formatting and metadata content standards for almost all datasets in the JRN data catalog.\nNew standards and workflows to manage and publish specialized (non-tabular) datasets, such as ground-based and airborne imagery, were developed in collaboration with data managers in the LTER network and beyond (Gries et al. 2021).\nThe JRN data catalog was revised to enhance discovery and access to: (a) data published outside of EDI, (b) geospatial data, and (c), data from collaborating research networks and partners.\n\nFuture initiatives: The IM team will continue making steady improvements to the JRN IM system and the quality and FAIR status of JRN data. The next six years will bring significant changes to JRN research priorities and data, and the IM team plans to support these transitions. Planned improvements during JRN-8 are:\n\nThe IM team will expand its focus on the re-use of JRN data by harmonizing datasets, creating analysis-ready data products, and developing analytical applications. We will use open-source tools like R and Python, and leverage recent improvements in JRN metadata standards and publishing efficiency.\nJRN research projects continue to expand data collection via sensor networks. The IM team will extend the use of the MATLAB GCE Toolbox by implementing a new time series database for these data, and open-source tools to manage, publish, and access them efficiently. A pilot project for this began in 2023 in coordination with the HyMet working group, a joint effort of the LTER Network, EDI, CUAHSI, and the Dendra project. A side benefit of this work will be accessibility of real-time information about field conditions that will improve researcher safety.\nSeveral JRN-8 projects propose to collect and use ground-based and aerial imagery (e.g. phenocams, UAS imagery) as a survey and monitoring method to complement or replace manual fieldwork. The IM team will respond with suitable data management protocols and accessibility tools.\nAs noted above, biological specimens and physical samples are a key product of JRN research. In JRN-8, the IM team will work to (a) identify JRN physical sample and specimen collections and make a comprehensive catalog accessible via the JRN website, and (b) develop new protocols to preserve and archive scientifically useful environmental samples (soil, biocrust, tissues), or resulting DNA extracts, into appropriate collections. For (b) we are discussing partnership options with the Museum of Southwestern Biology and the NEON Biorepository, and examining supplemental funding opportunities.\nThe Jornada Dryland Modeling team is proposing ecological modeling capabilities that will (a) consume observational datasets and other training data, (b) undergo intensive software development over time, and (c) produce simulation outputs for a variety of research questions and applications. The JRN IM team is embedded in this effort and will ensure that modeling activity and relevant data products are preserved and publicly accessible."

    "text": "Project-level metadata and spatial data issues\nThere are some workflows for creating, organizing, and tracking projects and their location data at the Jornada. For instance, John Anderson’s “Research notification” system tracks approved research projects and should, in theory, initiate collection of metadata for each project. However, research projects commonly suffer from a lack of metadata collection and accessibility after the approval phase, and information gathered during the approval phase is not widely accessible to Jornada researchers or the public. Some things that would help address this problem:\n\nA project metadata database (what experiments are happening or have happened, who is in charge, what are the questions, measurements, infrastructure) that is accessible to John and other project managers.\nA “canonical” spatial database for the Jornada that links to project IDs. This spatial database would house plot locations, sensor locations, and other coordinates telling users where experiments happened over time.\nA reference collection of ancillary spatial data products (roads, fence lines, vegetation, geomorphology). We have some of this, but its not very complete and there are multiple copies of everything.\n\nEach of these resources would be most useful when shared among multiple partners at the Jornada (LTAR, LTER, etc.). The Jornada IT infrastructure and data management working group, which includes USDA, Landscape Data Commons, and LTER staff, is beginning to address some of these issues and tasks in a coordinated way."

Some of our future initiatives, such as Data Bounty Hunters, would greatly benefit from such a platform. A Mailman server, mailing list/group web services (MailChimp, Groups.io), or messaging platforms (Zulip, Slack) are possible candidates, but we need either infrastructure or budget to adopt these.\nIt may be difficult to spend LTER budget for non-research activity, but we need some funds to make Jornada T-Shirts, hats, or stickers that could be used to encourage/reward participation in Jornada outreach initiatives (Data Bounty Hunters, for instance again)."

Currently, however, this option does not appear viable because the JER server infrastructure is out of date and undergoing a long transition to a more modern, stable, and supportable system. Thus, in 2020 the IM team was unable to provision a virtual server on this system. While we await progress on JER server systems, we are investigating ways we can meet our IT needs using NMSU or cloud providers (AWS, Google services), but these will require some LTER budget. Any suggestions regarding server resources available at Jornada or partner institutions are welcomed by the IM team.\nAgain, the Jornada IT infrastructure and data management working group, is beginning to address some of these issues in a coordinated way."

    "text": "JRN Metabase (jrn_metabase) is a PostgreSQL database that can be stored and accessed on either a local or remote host. Generally we configure it on a remote host for multi-user access. PostgreSQL uses a client/server model, which means that the database server application (postgres) runs on the host system and manages the databases and all incoming connections from client applications. Users can choose from a number of client applications to connect to a server and database(s), either locally (from the server’s host machine), or remotely. The standard, commandline client interface to PostgreSQL is psql, which can be, or already is, installed on most computers. We also use DBeaver as a graphical client for jrn_metabase. Links to PostgreSQL and community documentation are on the Postgres Links page.\n\n\nFor the remote host, we use an Ubuntu server running an up-to-date PostgreSQL server. To access a remote host over a terminal connection use:\nssh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;host name or IP&gt;\nNote that if the host you are accessing is a Jornada server you will need to use the Jornada VPN from outside Wooton Hall.\nTo install PostgreSQL, use the most current installation method for the host’s operating system. We installed the default packages available in the latest version of Ubuntu Server. In Linux systems (Ubuntu, Debian, macOS, etc), installation of PostgreSQL creates a system user and a database server role that are both named postgres. The PostgreSQL administrative shell client, called `psql’, is also installed by default. Many more details on PostgreSQL server administration setup and administration can be found in the official PG Administrator Guide.\n\n\nWhen logged into the PostgreSQL host, any system user with sudoer privileges can switch to the postgres user and enter the psql shell with:\nsudo -u postgres psql\nThe postgres=# prompt will appear indicating you have entered the shell in the postgres role, which is the default administrative role with superuser privileges. It has no password set on a new install(, so that will need to be set according to instructions below.)\nOther PostgreSQL roles should be created for database users. Once these are created and remote access is configured on the host, psql can be run from remote clients (if installed) so that users can login to databases on the host using commands like:\npsql -U &lt;rolename&gt; -h &lt;hostname or IP&gt; -p &lt;postgres port&gt; &lt;database name&gt;\nIn general the postgres port is 5432.\n\n\n\nThere are several configurations to set to allow remote access to a PostgreSQL database cluster. Some of these changes involve editing config files and some involve using psql. Most likely you’ll do this from your user account on the host machine. Check these instructions for updates.\n\nEdit postgresql.conf to allow remote connections. To do this, open the file (usually in /etc/postgresql/&lt;version&gt;/main) and locate the listen_addresses='localhost' line, uncomment if needed, and change it to:\nlisten_addresses=‘*’\nNow give the postgres user a password. Enter the psql as the default user (postgres)\n sudo -u postgres psql  # assuming logged on to host as a sudoer\nThen change the postgres role’s password to something more secure\n postgres=# ALTER USER postgres WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '&lt;password&gt;';\nAlter the PostgreSQL authentication config file to allow user postgres to authenticate with md5 when making a remote (TCP/IP) connection.\n sudo vim /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf\nAdd a line that looks like like this:\n hostssl   template1         postgres     0.0.0.0/0       scram-sha-256\nYou could also restrict by database, or ip.\nFor other users, you can add a similar line to pg_hba.conf beneath the one above to allow remote connections - just change postgres to the user name. This can allow users from any IP (0.0.0.0/0) to login using md5. You could also let all users in this way:\nhost    all     all      0.0.0.0/0      md5\nBut it isn’t that secure.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some recommended roles to add to a PostgreSQL cluster for LTER_core_metabase (defined here). This will most likely be done in psql while logged into the host.\n\nCreate a role for the database owner and set password\n postgres=# CREATE ROLE &lt;name&gt; CREATEDB CREATEROLE LOGIN;\n postgres=# ALTER USER &lt;name&gt; WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '&lt;password&gt;';\nCreate other roles specified for LTER_core_metabase. If you create these before creating the LTER_core_metabase in the steps below, they will be granted the correct permissions to the schema and tables.\n CREATE ROLE read_write_metabase;\n CREATE ROLE read_only_metabase;\nIf for some reason permissions for these roles need correction, or a new role needs to be added, you might need to re-run the permission granting section in the database dump for LTER-core-metabase (onebigfile.sql), potentially after substituting in the new role name. JRN created a separate user for one of its metabases (jrn_metabase_dev) using this method.\nAfter making changes on server restart the postgres server.\n sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some PostgreSQL tools available in Linux userspace, so while logged in to the host, you can create a testing database for a user role with:\ncreatedb -O &lt;username&gt; &lt;databasename&gt;\nOr you can log into psql as a particular role and do:\nusername=# CREATE DATABASE &lt;databasename&gt;\nOnce this database is created you can log in to the database from the system shel (Note the uppercase -U flag to denote the user):\npsql -U &lt;username&gt; &lt;databasename&gt;\nOr connect from within psql:\nusername=# \\c &lt;databasename&gt;\nAfter logging in you can issue SQL commands and queries or use the psql metacommands that are prepended by a backslash and described here.\n\n\n\nAt Jornada, we are basically using a “stock” version of LTER-core-metabase. It only takes a few minor modifications to install the source.\n\nOn the host machine, clone the lter_core_metabase git repository then cd into the directory.\nEdit the 2 sql files, sql/00_create_db.sql and sql/onebigfile.sql, to replace ‘%db_owner%’ with the name of the database owner role you created. This could be done with a standard text editor or sed.\nCreate the database:\n sudo -u postgres psql -f GitHub/LTER-core-metabase/sql/00_create_db.sql\nIf there is a locale error you may edit locales in 00_create_db.sql to one present on your system (C.UTF-8 worked best for JRN), and/or create a new locale for your system (locale-gen...).\nSet up the schema with onebigfile.sql (this is if logged on to host).\n psql -U &lt;db_owner username&gt; -h localhost -d lter_core_metabase &lt; GitHub/LTER-core-metabase/sql/onebigfile.sql\n\n\n\n\nThere are patches created for LTER_core_metabase periodically that may add new features or fix bugs between versions. These are in the migration branch of the LTER-core-metabase GitHub repository.

    "text": "For the remote host, we use an Ubuntu server running an up-to-date PostgreSQL server. To access a remote host over a terminal connection use:\nssh &lt;username&gt;@&lt;host name or IP&gt;\nNote that if the host you are accessing is a Jornada server you will need to use the Jornada VPN from outside Wooton Hall.\nTo install PostgreSQL, use the most current installation method for the host’s operating system. We installed the default packages available in the latest version of Ubuntu Server. In Linux systems (Ubuntu, Debian, macOS, etc), installation of PostgreSQL creates a system user and a database server role that are both named postgres. The PostgreSQL administrative shell client, called `psql’, is also installed by default. Many more details on PostgreSQL server administration setup and administration can be found in the official PG Administrator Guide.\n\n\nWhen logged into the PostgreSQL host, any system user with sudoer privileges can switch to the postgres user and enter the psql shell with:\nsudo -u postgres psql\nThe postgres=# prompt will appear indicating you have entered the shell in the postgres role, which is the default administrative role with superuser privileges. It has no password set on a new install(, so that will need to be set according to instructions below.)\nOther PostgreSQL roles should be created for database users. Once these are created and remote access is configured on the host, psql can be run from remote clients (if installed) so that users can login to databases on the host using commands like:\npsql -U &lt;rolename&gt; -h &lt;hostname or IP&gt; -p &lt;postgres port&gt; &lt;database name&gt;\nIn general the postgres port is 5432.\n\n\n\nThere are several configurations to set to allow remote access to a PostgreSQL database cluster. Some of these changes involve editing config files and some involve using psql. Most likely you’ll do this from your user account on the host machine. Check these instructions for updates.\n\nEdit postgresql.conf to allow remote connections. To do this, open the file (usually in /etc/postgresql/&lt;version&gt;/main) and locate the listen_addresses='localhost' line, uncomment if needed, and change it to:\nlisten_addresses=‘*’\nNow give the postgres user a password. Enter the psql as the default user (postgres)\n sudo -u postgres psql  # assuming logged on to host as a sudoer\nThen change the postgres role’s password to something more secure\n postgres=# ALTER USER postgres WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '&lt;password&gt;';\nAlter the PostgreSQL authentication config file to allow user postgres to authenticate with md5 when making a remote (TCP/IP) connection.\n sudo vim /etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf\nAdd a line that looks like like this:\n hostssl   template1         postgres     0.0.0.0/0       scram-sha-256\nYou could also restrict by database, or ip.\nFor other users, you can add a similar line to pg_hba.conf beneath the one above to allow remote connections - just change postgres to the user name. This can allow users from any IP (0.0.0.0/0) to login using md5. You could also let all users in this way:\nhost    all     all      0.0.0.0/0      md5\nBut it isn’t that secure.\n\n\n\n\nThere are some recommended roles to add to a PostgreSQL cluster for LTER_core_metabase (defined here). This will most likely be done in psql while logged into the host.\n\nCreate a role for the database owner and set password\n postgres=# CREATE ROLE &lt;name&gt; CREATEDB CREATEROLE LOGIN;\n postgres=# ALTER USER &lt;name&gt; WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '&lt;password&gt;';\nCreate other roles specified for LTER_core_metabase. If you create these before creating the LTER_core_metabase in the steps below, they will be granted the correct permissions to the schema and tables.\n CREATE ROLE read_write_metabase;\n CREATE ROLE read_only_metabase;\nIf for some reason permissions for these roles need correction, or a new role needs to be added, you might need to re-run the permission granting section in the database dump for LTER-core-metabase (onebigfile.sql), potentially after substituting in the new role name. JRN created a separate user for one of its metabases (jrn_metabase_dev) using this method.\nAfter making changes on server restart the postgres server.\n sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service",

See the basics of this in the setup page and PostgreSQL specifics for the pg_hba.conf file.\n\n\n\nNew user tasks\nThe administrator (site IM for now), will email you a username and password that will allow you to login to the host and the PostgreSQL server. You will need to at least change the PostgreSQL server password for your user account.\n\nOpen a terminal on your computer and check to see if you have the PostgreSQL client (psql) installed.

Don’t forget to leave the single quotes around your new password, but you will leave them out when accessing the database.\n\nIf you don’t have psql available and can connect to jrn_metabase server with DBeaver, you may instead open an SQL console or SQL script window and type and execute this command:\n    ALTER USER &lt;username&gt; WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '&lt;password&gt;';\nIn either case you will need to change the password in your locally-stored connection info (e.g. for DBeaver and R) for future logins.\n\n\nDropping roles\nUser roles that no longer need access to a database or cluster should be dropped. The DROP ROLE SQL command will do this, as will the dropuser client application. Often a role will have ownership of database objects, so those ownerships need to be reassigned before dropping.
