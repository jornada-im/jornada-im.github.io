The tool is new but has rapidly developed to become an excellent method to author well-documented datasets. There is a Jornada EML template available on the site, so the recommended process for Jornada researchers is:\n\nLog in to ezEML using your Google, GitHub, or ORCID account (whichever is easiest).\nStart a new EML document using the “EML Documents &gt; New from Template” menu item\nNavigate to and select the “LTER/JRN/JRN_template_general” template to open a document template pre-populated with Jornada metadata.\nGive the document a unique name. You can save your metadata and then return to this document anytime.\nFollow the sequence of forms on the left, and ezEML’s prompts, to upload data files and enter metadata for your dataset. Each section of your metadata will have help available (“?” icons) and several fields will already be filled if you are using the JRN template.\nUse the “Check metadata” and “Check data tables” tools at the bottom left to check the completeness and validity of your dataset. Green lights mean your dataset is well described and ready to share.\nWhen ready, click “Submit/Share Package” and then “Collaborate with Colleagues”. DO NOT USE “Submit Package to EDI” or we may miss your dataset.\nOn the “Invite a Collaborator” screen share the dataset with a Jornada data manager (mailto:jornada.data@nmsu.edu).\n\nAt this point, the Jornada IM Team will receive a notification and can access your dataset in ezEML to review, edit, and publish to EDI.",

For LTER datasets there are three Trello boards that represent how Jornada datasets are split into three categories:\n\nCore - ongoing, high priority datasets that are updated regularly (once per year we hope). Many of these are collected by the JRN field crew.\nNon-core - lower-priority and completed datasets.\nWorks in progress (‘WIP’) - datasets that are brand new or as-yet unpublished. Many are in the development/review phase, or are awaiting publication of results associated with the data.\n\nContact someone on the IM team to get added to these boards.\n\n\nData management resources\nIf you are wondering whether the content or format of a metadata file (EML) is correct and complete, see our metadata standards documents. They are specific to Jornada Basin LTER data packages. THESE ARE DRAFTS and subject to change!\n\nGeneral Jornada metadata standards for all data packages (this is a bit out of date)\nJornada keyword thesauri (.xlsx) list keywords that should appear in all Jornada metadata files.\nAlso see the full Jornada IM documentation pages",
