# For Data Managers

Jornada data managers, including the IM team, should follow LTER and Jornada standards and best practices when creating metadata files and publishing research data packages. 

## Jornada metadata standards

If you are wondering whether the content or format of a metadata file (EML) is correct and complete, see our metadata standards documents. They are specific to Jornada Basin LTER data packages. **THESE ARE DRAFTS** and subject to change!

* [General Jornada metadata standards](https://github.com/jornada-im/jrn_metadata_standards/raw/master/JRN_metadata_standards.docx) (.docx) for all data packages
* [Jornada keyword thesauri](https://github.com/jornada-im/jrn_metadata_standards/raw/master/keyword_thesauri.xlsx) (.xlsx) list keywords that should appear in all Jornada metadata files.

## EML creation

* We have an [EMLassemblyline "testing" repository](https://github.com/jornada-im/jrn_emlassemblyline) to help the IM team learn and test EMLassemblyline.

## Full IM documentation

The Jornada LTER Data Management Plan, developed for the 2020 LTER proposal, outlines current data management practices and future initiatives of the IM team.

* [JRN LTER Data Management Plan (DRAFT)](JRN_LTER_data_management_plan_draft.md)

Full documentation of Jornada information management systems is a work in progress under development here:
