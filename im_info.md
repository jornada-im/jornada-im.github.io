# For Data Managers

Jornada data managers, including the IM team, should follow LTER and Jornada standards and best practices when creating metadata files and publishing research data packages. 

## Jornada metadata standards

If you are wondering whether the content or format of a metadata file (EML) is correct and complete, see our metadata standards documents. They are specific to Jornada Basin LTER data packages. **THESE ARE DRAFTS** and subject to change!

* [General Jornada metadata standards](https://github.com/jornada-im/documentation/raw/master/standards/JRN_metadata_standards.docx) (.docx) for all data packages
* [Jornada keyword thesauri](https://github.com/jornada-im/documentation/raw/master/standards/keyword_thesauri.xlsx) (.xlsx) list keywords that should appear in all Jornada metadata files.

## EML creation

* We have an [EMLassemblyline "testing" repository](https://github.com/jornada-im/jrn_emlassemblyline) to help the IM team learn and test EMLassemblyline.

## Full IM documentation

The Jornada IM team is developing comprehensive documentation pages covering the workings of the data management system at Jornada Basin LTER (JRN) at our GitHub organization:

* [JRN documentation repository](https://jornada-im.github.io/documentation)

Part of this documentation, the JRN Data Management Plan, developed for the 2020 LTER proposal, outlines current data management practices and future initiatives of the IM team.

* [JRN LTER Data Management Plan](https://jornada-im.github.io/documentation/JRN_LTER_data_management_plan.v3)
